# 🏡 House Price Classification with Supervised Learning

This project is part of my **Data Science Bootcamp** at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/).  
The goal of the project is to use **Supervised Machine Learning** algorithms to predict whether a house is **expensive or not** (binary classification).  

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

We used a dataset containing various **house features** such as size, number of rooms, location, and more.  
Our objective was to train and compare multiple classification algorithms using **scikit-learn** to identify which model performs best in predicting high-priced houses.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train multiple classification models  
   - Compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve  
   - Feature Importance (for tree-based models)  

---

## 📊 Results

Each model’s performance was compared based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

The final evaluation helped determine which algorithm best classifies houses as “expensive” or “not expensive.”
